# Bingo_FX

- Automated two-player Bingo game using Java FX.

- Each player's Bingo card is generated with random values, except for the FREE box which is already crossed out by default.

- Every time "Draw New Number" is pressed, a random Bingo value is created and displayed on the pane.

- A winner is chosen once a full row is crossed out, whether that is diagonal, horizontal, or vertical.

- If all 25 Bingo numbers are drawn and there is no winner, then the result is a draw.
